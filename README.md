## About
This project was created as part of the ‘Trust in SODA’ hackathon held in partnership with Code Institute. “The main goal of the project was to create a tool that helps employers create a truly accessible workspace, or improve their recruitment and onboarding experience for every person”. 

### Project Goals
Team Goals
* Gain experience in working in an Agile software development team.
* Learn new coding techniques and methods in existing and new languages.
* Increase confidence in coding ability.
* Work together in a team well and communicate effectively.
* Broaden perspective of the software development process.
* Gain knowledge in matters of inclusion, diversity and equality in the software and workforce environment.

Site Goals
* Provide information on what inclusion, diversity and equality are.
* Ensure the site content is accessible for all with sufficient navigation techniques for screen readers and tabbing, suitable colour palettes for those with colour vision deficiencies, and having multiple different formats for content including audio and visual guidance. 
* Showcase the benefits of having a diverse workforce to employers/companies.
* Provide information regarding the variety of ways an inclusive and accessible workforce can be created.
* Provide good and bad office space comparison examples for companies and employees to be able to visualise the different ways of creating an inclusive workplace.
* Provide companies/employers with a platform to engage with interactive content to test whether their office space is accessible enough.
* Provide information about other accessories and products that are available in the market to help different people based on their additional and/or unique needs.


## Planning
### Choosing a Topic / Focus
We used Slack as a platform to create group and put forward potential ideas. All of the team put forward multiple ideas, talking about each one and tweaking until a final decision was made that the entire team was happy with, confirmed by a poll. We decided that we wanted to focus on what an accessible and inclusive office / workspace could include, and some accessories that could assist in making the working environment as accessible as possible.

It was important to us that this did not just focus on physical disabilities, but all matters of diversity and disability: Age, gender, sex, ethnicity, race, religion, criminal history, military status, age, parental status, marriage status, visible and invisible disabilities and so much more.

### Team Roles
Within the team there were a variety of different skill sets, expertise and experience, so we wanted to make sure that everyone was valued equally and had a part to play. We started by creating a poll to highlight the programming languages that everyone felt comfortable with, and then decided on a SCRUM master to help organise the project (Aidan). Roles and responsibilities were then divided across the team into multiple areas including (but not exclusive to): React JS coding, image creations, wireframe creations, page creations, git version control, research and documentation with team members often working together in multiple areas to complete a single task and ensure more than one perspective was captured. 

### Polls and Wireframes
Once the topic had been chosen, we created a rough outline of the page contents and mock ups were first created by pen and paper. Where there were multiple layout options and considerations, polls were undertaken and discussion had to come up with a final decision.

Once the final decision had been made on the mock ups that most closely resembled the layout and design of the website, more hi-fi mock ups were created in word documents to allow the team to edit them, then a final wireframe was created in Balsamiq. Some changes were made along the way but these were our main guidelines.

## UX

### User Stories
* As an employee who is disabled, I want to find examples of adjustments that can be made in an office to suit my disability, so that I can remain at my current role and perform to my best ability.
* As an employer/company who is seeking to diversify my workforce, I want to know the benefits of a diverse workforce, so that I can use this information to tailor my recruitment campaigns and methodologies.
* As an employer/company that has a disabled employee, I want to find information on office space and accessories, so that I can put in place adjustments to help my employee.

### Design
It was important to ensure that the website was incredibly accessible considering the nature of the topic and the likely user. Therefore it was important to design it ensuring it was clear and concise throughout. We ensured there was always a 1/3 style layout in three columns for consistency, whilst allowing these elements to stack on one another if the screen size was smaller. 

Colour was also an incredibly important part of the design considerations considering there are people with colour vision deficiencies. An inclusive colour palette was used that had been tested against various online resources listed in the credits below and was seen to be appropriate for the four types of colour vision deficiencies.
