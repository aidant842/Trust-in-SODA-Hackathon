                    other's ideas and opinions, resulting in increased
                    creativity and new perspectives. The more diverse the

                    Hiring out-of-market people can lead to a variety of new
                    perspectives on the organization, industry, and policies
                    that would not have been noticed otherwise. It may be useful

                    It might be difficult for others to feel included or fit in
                    a job where the majority of workers are from the same
                    background, ability, gender, etc. These hurdles can be taken
                    down in a more diverse company, which fosters an inclusive
                    culture and empowers all employees equally. Employees will
                    perform better in an inclusive workplace, and there will be
                    less turnover and absenteeism, resulting in higher employee
                    retention than in a heterogeneous workforce.

                    Providing accommodation services for those with disabilities
                    can help to improve efficiency and reduce time to achieve
                    results. Accommodations include well designed physical
                    workplace layout, accessories such as noise cancelling
                    earphones, workstations with digital services.

                    When companies are shown to hire a diverse team, it expands
                    recruitment resources, which improve a companies brand's
                    reputation. Diversity binds you to the people around you and
                    makes you more relatable to a wider range of people opening
                    up the recruitment pool.

                    Companies that embrace these diverse policies profit
                    financially. These could result from a decrease in legal
                    action taken as a consequence of the lack in services being
                    delivered both physically and online. Compliancy needs to be
                    ensured whether it is by meeting layout criteria or adapting
                    websites to suit the accessibility and diversity.{" "}
